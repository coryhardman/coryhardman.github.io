I came across a greatÂ <a title="http://floating-point-gui.de/" href="http://">article</a> about the pit falls of using floating point numbers in programming. All to often software bugs come up because developers expect something like 0.1+0.2==0.3. The article goes into very clear detail as to why it is not the case that we can expect exact equality while using float point representations.
