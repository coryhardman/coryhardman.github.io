<strong><strong><em><a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/">Dr. Dave Marshall</a> at <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/">Cardiff School of Computer Science</a> has written a <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/CE.html">great C tutorial</a>. This tutorial is mostly aimed at UNIX C developers and covers the basics of C programming to advanced multi-threaded application development. This is the tutorial that I used to learn C and I still open it up whenever I need to look up something new or need a quick refresher on something. Unfortunately it appears that Google keeps burying the link so I thought it would be helpful to others that are looking for in my opinion the best C tutorial available online. </em> </strong></strong>
