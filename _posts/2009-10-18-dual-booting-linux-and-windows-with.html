I have always been told in order to dual boot Linux and Windows you must first install Windows then Linux. The idea being that Window's boot loader does not play nicely with Linux like Grub or Lilo does. However it is often easier to install Linux then Windows; like with the up coming Windows 7 release, Linux users may want to try out Windows 7 without having to reinstall their Linux installs. I cam across a <a href="http://apcmag.com/how_to_dualboot_vista_with_linux_linux_is_already_installed.htm?page=1">great tutorial </a>on how to do just this.
