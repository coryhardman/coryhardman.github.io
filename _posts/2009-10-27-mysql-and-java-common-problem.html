Have you ever received the following error while using Java and MySQL:<br/><blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '????????????????' at line 1</span></blockquote><br/><span style="color: #000000;">This is a common error when you first set up Java and MySQL to work together. To correct it simply add the following lines of code to your my.cnf in the section [mysqld]</span><br/><blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">collation_server=utf8_general_ci<br/>character_set_server=utf8</span></blockquote>
