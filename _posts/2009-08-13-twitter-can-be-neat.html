If&nbsp; you are like me you don't exactly see the usefulness of the social networking site <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.&nbsp;After reading a recent wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/08/twittering-toaster/">article</a> I can not better see that usefulness. There appears to be some pretty clever people connecting common house hold devices to Twitter.<br /><br />This really isn't all that new of a concept however. People have been connecting bots to IRC for control for a very long time now. I would suspect similar devices have been plugged into IRC. I wonder about the secuirty behind putting so much control of your house onto the net. Losing control of your own account could give an attacker control of say your air conditioning and drop your house to 60 degrees. Causing your electric bill to&nbsp;ski rocket.
