My name is Cory Hardman. I am the Head of Security at [OpenSea](https://opensea.io). [My team is hiring](https://jobs.lever.co/OpenSea/04622947-f167-4d39-ad3c-d0a3ede4ffc4), come help build the future of Web3!

I graduated from [Kansas State University](http://ksu.edu) with degrees in

Google in the Payments Platform team. I joined the Payments Security team in
2013 and went onto lead it.
