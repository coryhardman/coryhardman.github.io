I managed to talk the <a href="http://cis.ksu.edu">K-State CIS</a> department into sending a team, including myself, to <a href="http://sc10.supercomputing.org/">SuperComputing 2010</a> to compete in the <a href="http://sc10.sc-education.org/conference/studentcontest.php">student programming contest</a>. As a team of 5 members we had a combined total years of experience with super computers of about a year. To our surprise we placed <a href="http://www.k-state.edu/media/newsreleases/dec10/ciscontest121410.html">third</a>. So looks like we are going to try going for gold next year in Seattle, WA at SuperComputing 2011.<br/><br/>If you are interested in the questions you can find them <a href="http://wiki.sc-education.org/index.php/Sc10-student-contest">here</a>.
